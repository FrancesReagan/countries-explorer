### COUNTRIES EXPLORER APP üåçüö©
This Application is modern and responsive and built with React. It allows users to explore countries from around the world by providing
detailed information, search functinality, and light/dark theme switching capabilities. I deviated from the norm and made this with a 
desk-top first approach featuring large, readable fonts, and spacious layouts--as its what I like:).

__Features__

*Browse the World's countries: view information on about 250 countries*

*Real-Time Search: search by country name with responsive filtering*

*Region Filtering: filter countries by continent--Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania).*

*Detailed Country View: click on a country flag to see detailed information about that country:

 -Native name and population statistics.
 
 -Region, sub-region, and captial city.
 
 -Languages and currencies.
 
 -Top-level domain information (i.e. each country's internet domain extension--United States--.us).
 
 -Border countries display (show neighboring countries by three letter country abbreviation).----planning to make this interactive in next interation.
 
*Light/Dark Theme: toggle between light or dark modes*

*Responsive Layout: responsive design that adapts from desktop to mobile.*

*Modern animations: on drop-drop menus--hover effects and subtle transitions-- and loading states*

__Tech Used__

*React 19-modern React with functional components and hooks*

*Vite 6-build tool and development server*

*REST Countries API-comprehensive country data (public--no API key required)*

*Lucide React- modern icon library*

*CSS grid & flexbox - advanced responsive layout techniques*

*CSS custom properties- dynamic theme switching implementation*

__React Concepts__

*Component Architecture: reusable components with clear functionalities*

*State Management: useState, useContext, and custom hooks (useCountries)*

*Side Effects: useEffect for API calls and lifecycle management*

*Performance optimization: useMemo for expensive filtering calculations (without useMemo--this amount of filtering and would be re-rendering would be costly in CPU intensive, time-consuming, and resource-heavy).*

*Conditional rendering: dynamic UI based on the application state*

*Event handling: complex user interactions and form controls*

*Error Boundaries: graceful error handling and loading states*
